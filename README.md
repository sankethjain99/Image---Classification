# Image-Classification
Using amazon sagemaker


In this project, we trained and deploy an image classifier using Amazon Sagemaker. We used the image classification algorithm from Sagemaker to create, train and deploy a model that isbe able to classify 37 breeds of dogs and cats from the popular IIIT-Oxford Pets Dataset.<br>


In this project, we  focus on three learning objectives:<br>

Prepare data for Sagemaker Image Classifier<br>
Train a model using Sagemaker<br>
Deploy a model using Sagemaker<br>
